//12.Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.
var names = ['Ahsan', 'Zain', 'Usman'];
names.forEach(function (name) { console.log("This is my friend: ".concat(name)); });
