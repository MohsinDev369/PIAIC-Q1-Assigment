//12.Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.

let names = ['Ahsan', 'Zain', 'Usman']

names.forEach(name => { console.log(`This is my friend: ${name}`) })
